# At what address do the EPIT or GPT registers need to be mapped and accessed through?


# What value must be programmed to the timer to get a frequency of x milliseconds?


# How are the interrupts acknowledged?
Through an async EP
	- Which is passed to `start_timer()`
	- A re-badged `_sos_interrupt_ep_cap` which is minted in main.c
	- `timer_interrupt()` is the callback function of the endpoint which handles all the interrupts
		- currently just prints a debug message

# Periodic timer ticks or variable length time-outs (a so called tickless kernel)?
Desireable to have variable length time-outs

# Single or multi-threaded driver?
Single?

# Which data structures should I use?
Priority Queue

# What race conditions might exist? (imagine the timer hardware as parallel thread of execution). More specifically, how do you derive a 64-bit timer from a 32-bit one.

# What is an acceptable granularity/resolution for timeouts/timestamps? Hint: 100ms is too long, 1ms ticks are too frequent for timer ticks, though your timestamp should be more accurate than 1ms.

# In principle, good device drivers attempt to minimise the length of interrupt handling code.
