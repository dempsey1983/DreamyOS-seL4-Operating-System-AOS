# At what address do the EPIT or GPT registers need to be mapped and accessed through?

# What value must be programmed to the timer to get a frequency of x milliseconds?

# How are the interrupts acknowledged?

# Periodic timer ticks or variable length time-outs (a so called tickless kernel)?

# Single or multi-threaded driver?

# Which data structures should I use?

# What race conditions might exist? (imagine the timer hardware as parallel thread of execution). More specifically, how do you derive a 64-bit timer from a 32-bit one.

# What is an acceptable granularity/resolution for timeouts/timestamps? Hint: 100ms is too long, 1ms ticks are too frequent for timer ticks, though your timestamp should be more accurate than 1ms.

#In principle, good device drivers attempt to minimise the length of interrupt handling code.
